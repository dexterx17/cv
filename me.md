My road start 10 years ago

in my university 

Introduce yourself
Well i'm Jaime Santana, i'm 32 years and i studied system enginering in the University,

- However in the college i studied tourism, i like to talk about that becuase  i love the nature and animals, and was during my last college intership when my road in the world of developing started.

i started my first job in the Environmental Management department of provincial government in Tungurahua (the province where i live), so there i worked with maps and we build a web system to view and query data about natural resources of the province and also manage information about many social projects that goverment work in these areas.

There we configured our own servers, we had a Postgres Server for relational information and MongoDb for storage documents and metheorological information colected by methorological stations, also we had a web server with apache to host our system build with Codeigniter for the backend and Bootstrap with Jquery for the front, also we set up a mapserver with many WMS to visualize geospatial information, in that time we used mapbender as client to show our maps and integrate it with our system.

I also worked with some batch scripts to automatize the collect of data from metheorological stations, automatize backups and manage queues.

Then i started working in a university in a research laboratory financied by CEDIA(national company that invest in I+D) and ESPE (is a university of the armed forces), in this laboratory i worked with a multi-disciplinary team that include electronic engineers, mathematicians, and software engineers, we make experiments with automation controls for robots, and i build a User interface for monitoring the comunication between operators and robots, for this comunnication channel i used nodejs to serve a websocket and to storage data in a realtime database (in that case we use memsql).

In some of the experiments of the laboratory i did some scripts in python for webscraping, using beautifulsoup library and i storage it in json, also we build a brand called BEAVR focused on Virtual Reality experiences, in this project i tried to build a web tool for load 3d models in a GLB format and locate this in a specific coordinate and with it custom personalization like scale, rotate, angle, or camera position, for this tool i used CesiumJS to locate the models in the space and Laravel to build an API to storage this information and share it with the Unity applications build by my colleagues, 

I build a lot of API for different experiments, a touristic API, multimedia API for 3d models, Geo Espacial information.

QGIS tools 

i had the oportunity to work with Dji API (a brand drones) in android studio using java, also i worked with webrtc for send and receive data between o


After that the pandemy came and i started working by my own in many web systems, some for clients and others as a hobby.

One of my last projects is one i called fireman, this system helps to fire brigade to register and manage all the information related to his job, it includes a multi-role control layer, GPS monitoring system, alerts and many custom features,

I developed the first version of this system at the beginning of the pandemic I used laravel for the backend and i bought a template based on bootstrap and jquery for the front, in that time i was working in my own projects with vuejs to be able to master it, i made petgis.com, wekain.com, pilllarociudadleyanda.com, all of them base on laravel and vuejs, well in the front i tried different aproachs with each one, so i can build my own deployment.


actually i'm developing the third version of fireman with the help of two jr. developers using laravel to build and API and vuejs with a template called vuexy.

And the last project as a hobby is one called ranktt it helps to lovers of table tennis players to register its matchs and see their rank and compare it with his friends, i used firebase as a backedn and vuejs for the front with tailwindcss
